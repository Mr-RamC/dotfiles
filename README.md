# dotfiles

.bashrc, .zshrc, .vimrc and the company

## Fresh install

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/candidtim/dotfiles/master/install.sh -O - | sh

## i3

I'm pretty sure I'm missing a lot of i3 configuration here,
because to the moment I only did it once and all manually, yet there are:

 * `/bin` - a couple of scripts to copy to `~/.bin`
 * `i3.sh` - to install requried pacakges to run i3

And following steps are manual for the moment:

 * install Yosemite San Francisco fonts
 * install Font Awesome
 * install [Arc GTK Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme), and Firefox theme as well
 * install [Moka icons](https://snwh.org/moka)
